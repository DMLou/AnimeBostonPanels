Hello, and thank you for applying to run a panel at Anime Boston 2014!

First, I would like you to know that pre-registration is now online at

http://www.animeboston.com/registration/online_registration/

All panel organizers are required to be pre-registered for their
panels to be considered at scheduling time. If you have not
pre-registered, you may be automatically waitlisted.

If you are a special case of panelist (press, dealer, guest, industry,
etc.), you don't need to worry about pre-registration. Just follow
whatever the appropriate procedures are to get your Anime Boston
membership badge. However, if you have not already done so, it
wouldn't hurt to remind me of your special case unless it is obvious
(i.e., you're representing a well-known anime company).

If you have already pre-registered, all you need to do is email me back
so I can mark it in my records. If you happen to have a badge number or
confirmation number, I would also like to note it in my records if
possible.

If you have not pre-registered, please do so as soon as possible and
then email me with your registration ID once your pre-registration is
complete.

In addition, this email is to confirm that I have received your
application for your panel titled:

<PanelName>

This is NOT a confirmation that you are on the schedule for Anime
Boston 2014. This is merely to let you know that I have received  your
application.

If you applied for more than one panel and did not receive a separate
email for each panel, then please contact me immediately in order to
correct the situation.

Thank you again.
