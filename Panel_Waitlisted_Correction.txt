Hello,

You may have just received an email an email saying that your panel named

<PanelName>

was off-topic in the subject, but was waitlisted in the body of the
email.

This email is to apologize for the error. I mistakenly sent the email
with the wrong subject.

Your panel was WAITLISTED, but it is also fully on-topic and will be
fully considered for inclusion at Anime Boston as the schedule
solidifies.

Once again, I'm sorry for any confusion my mistake caused.
