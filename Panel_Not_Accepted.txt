Hello,

This email is to let you know that your panel titled:

<PanelName>

was not accepted for Anime Boston 2014. Sorry. :(

However, if you are willing to run a panel on a totally last minute
basis (as in notified perhaps at the convention itself on the day
you'd possibly run your panel), please feel free to write back with
at-con contact information.  This way, if there are any cancellations,
we can reach you and possibly offer you a chance to run your panel
anyway.

Thank you.
