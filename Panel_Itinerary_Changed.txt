Dear <FirstName> <LastName>:

This email contains your updated Anime Boston 2014 panel itinerary. It
is being sent out due to some additional last minute schedule changes
that took place after the itinerary was last sent out. I apologize for
any confusion or inconvenience.

<ScheduledPanels>

The schedule here is HOPEFULLY the FINAL SCHEDULE for your panels.
Please cross-check this schedule with what's currently listed on the
web site for any contradictions. If there are any errors, notify me as
soon as possible so I can investigate and/or correct the contradictions.

=== CONVENTION CONTACT INFORMATION ===

In the case of a panel emergency, I can be reached at the convention
via cell phone at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Otherwise, please find me or leave a
message with another staffer in Programming Operations in Hynes room
200.

Thank you.
