Hello,

This email is to let you know that Anime Boston 2014 applications are
now online. Since you showed interest in hosting a panel at Anime
Boston 2013, I'm inviting you to apply again at Anime Boston 2014. If
you've already applied for your panels, you can safely ignore this
email.  Otherwise, you can apply for 2014's con at the following URL:

https://www.animeboston.com/forms/panel_application/

Please note that the deadline for applying for panels is January 25, 2014. I
apologize for the late notice, but I'm still adjusting to being a new father and
trying to figure out how to balance my time.

Thank you.
