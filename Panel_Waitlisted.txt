Hello,

This email is to let you know that your panel titled:

<PanelName>

has been WAITLISTED for Anime Boston 2014. Sorry. :(

Do not despair, however! Being "waitlisted" only means that we were
not sure if we could fit your panel into the schedule or not because
we haven't locked down our guest and industry schedule yet. To play it
safe, we decided to select a relatively low number of fan panels for
the time being with the rest of the schedule to be filled in once the
guest and industry schedule is nailed down.

Once the guest and industry schedule is complete, we will choose
additional fan panels to fill in any remaining slots on the schedule.

In addition, should any accepted panelist cancel, your panel will be
considered to replace the cancelled panel.

However, if you do not receive word of your panels acceptance before
the convention, you should assume that your panel was not accepted.
Sorry again. :(

Thank you.
