# Anime Boston Scripts

This is a github repo of all the scripts, templates, etc., I cooked up to work
on Anime Boston panel planning.

# Status

As of now, everything is here except for the LibreOffice database I used to hold
panel records. Basically, I need to create a version that contains only empty
tables with no personal data, but due to Java issues on my computer that I
haven't been able to work out, I haven't been able to access it.

I for one can't wait until LibreOffice ditches the Java-based database for Base.

Why the MPL? Well, there are aspects about both the GPL and BSD-style licenses
that I like and the MPL seems to be a good compromise between them. Use my code
anyway you want, but if you make improvements/changes/etc. to my code, you need
to open source those changes in kind. If you use it unmodified in your project,
you don't need to do squat, basically.
