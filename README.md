# Anime Boston Scripts

This is a github repo of all the scripts, templates, etc., I cooked up to work
on Anime Boston panel planning.

# Status

Everything is now here, including a database sanitized of personal information.

This code is released under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0.

Why the MPL? Well, there are aspects about both the GPL and BSD-style licenses
that I like and the MPL seems to be a good compromise between them. Use my code
anyway you want, but if you make improvements/changes/etc. to my code, you need
to open source those changes in kind. If you use it unmodified in your project,
you don't need to do squat, basically.
