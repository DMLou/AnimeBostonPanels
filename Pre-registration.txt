Hello,

This email is to let you know that pre-registration is now online at:

http://www.animeboston.com/registration

All panel organizers are required to be pre-registered for their
panels to be considered at scheduling time.

If you have already pre-registered, all you need to do is email me
back so I can mark it in my records. If you have not pre-registered,
please do so as soon as possible and then email me once your
pre-registration is complete.

Thank you.
